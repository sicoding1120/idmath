### Using npm

```bash
npm install idmath
```

## About the Developers

**idmath** was developed by a team of four passionate developers, each bringing unique expertise and a shared vision to create a tool that simplifies mathematical formula handling for developers. and these four developers are still students at a school in Indonesia, more precisely in the city of Bogor and the school is called SMK MadinatulQuran

## About the Developers

**idmath** was developed by a team of four developers:

- **Ahmad Faqih Abqory** - Responsible for the structure of the library, ensuring that it is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- **Daffa Hafizh Firdaus** - Focused on the core logic of the library, implementing the mathematical evaluation engine and ensuring its accuracy and performance.
- **Arga Dida** - Handled the unit testing, ensuring that the library functions correctly and reliably in different scenarios.
- **Muhammad Hardiansyah Setiadi** - Worked on the frontend integration, making sure the library is easy to use and well-documented for developers.

Together, they built **idmath** to simplify mathematical formula handling for developers.
